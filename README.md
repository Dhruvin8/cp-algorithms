The goal of this project is to translate the wonderful resource
[http://e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo) which provides descriptions of many algorithms
and data structures especially popular in field of competitive programming.
Moreover we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles
and adding new articles to the collection.
